# Thesis_code
Code and Data.

The code I wrote throughout my Master's Thesis research to plot and analyze the conductive polymer antenna and biological tissue measurements.

I've included all the measurements we took over the course of the research project. The file paths in the code won't run as they are, since they are hardcoded to run on my local machine, but the folders that contain the measurement data are named in such a way that future users could figure out 'what data goes where' in the code if they downloaded the data and wanted to run the code.
